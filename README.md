I am a son, a father, a boyfriend, an otaku and a developer. Love to learn everytime I can from everything sounround me, I have been lucky to learn from my kids, my girlfriend(and near future wife), colleagues and people from tech community. I am always keen to challenge whatever is presented in front of me and try to understand it and form my own opinion.

Enthusiastic developer that treat the technology as something interesting every single day, since every day new ways to approach and solve a problem is concieve and I get fascinated how quick human race evolves thanks to technology.

In the other hand, despite I like to read a lot about technology, I love to disconnect from time to time and watch TV shows normally based on true stories and also love to see Animes from any kind, and must important love to share those shows with my kids as much as I can.
